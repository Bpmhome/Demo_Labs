Prompt #1
First thing I've done is add my headers:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
This might be updated depending on what happens later down the road.
I created my variables and have inserted "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" to be my base string
Created encryption with for loop that adds 3 to the ASCII value for the main string
Gathered input string from user and checked using strcmp to compare to the decrypt key input
This results in an if else statement which will decrypt or just carry on into an error message and the program will stop
Trying to remove the substring and ran into an issue. Will address when fixed but currently using strcat to remove
Using strcmp I managed to compare winnings strings and pass through the game.
Comment the heck outta this.

Prompt #4
After including the headers I then went ahead and created my encryption/decryption
With a bit of working I realized that I was starting to get a lot of errors which were caused by a missing ampersand
Created a simple user menu to allow the user to choose what they want to do
Created a function that'll take user input and check the location of it and put it in Roman
Created some error handling that'll stop excessive input of certain variables
created a function that'll convert to decimal based off of input
